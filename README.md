# vidhigya
Vidhigya (विधिज्ञ) is an AI-first legal empowerment platform designed to bridge the gap between the Indian Constitution and the common citizen. The platform provides instant, easy-to-understand legal guidance using Grade-5 language, allowing users to speak their problems, upload legal documents for simplified summaries, and discover verified local advocates using geolocation.

Built as a client-side Single Page Application (SPA), Vidhigya leverages Google Gemini’s reasoning, multimodal, and grounding capabilities to deliver legal explanations, document risk analysis, and real-world advocate discovery—while maintaining low cost, scalability, and user trust. The platform also empowers advocates through verified profiles, ratings, and tiered visibility models.
